  "description": "OUTPAWFORM ($PAW) is a deflationary charity token combining animal welfare, transparency and real treasure hunts. Every 6 months, a fixed amount of tokens is sold to donate 100% of the proceeds to animal shelters. The exact same number of tokens is burned simultaneously, ensuring zero inflation. Additionally, the founder uses 10% of any real-life treasure findings to buy back and burn PAW tokens. All donations and burns are publicly announced on social media for full transparency.",
